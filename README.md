# Dataphyre Runtime Engine for PHP

> *It knows where it is... because it knows where it isn't.*

Dataphyre is more than a framework â€” itâ€™s a **modular runtime engine** designed for extreme performance, zero bloat, and real-world scalability. Whether youâ€™re launching a side project or operating a global-scale application, Dataphyre adapts to your needs without refactoring, and without compromise.

## Highlights

- **Live migration diffs**  
  Detect schema changes from your dev database and emit safe, versioned YAML migrations per table.

- **Dynamic unit test generation**  
  Automatically generate test cases from real function calls and type shapes â€” zero boilerplate.

- **Runtime diagnostics**  
  Inject trace logs, introspect module state, and verify boot sequences with granular tools.

- **Modular boot structure**  
  Shared roots, app-specific overrides, and truly separated module scopes (`common_dataphyre`, `dataphyre`, per-app).

- **Ready for scale**  
  Dataphyre is built to power applications that process billions of requests per day â€” with no third-party runtime overhead.

## Why Dataphyre?

Unlike traditional frameworks, Dataphyre **builds with you**, not against you.  
You don't need to scaffold your app around rigid conventions or dependencies â€” just write your code.  
The runtime will optimize the rest.
